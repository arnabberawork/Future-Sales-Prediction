## Problem Statement
Predicting future sales accurately is a critical challenge for businesses aiming to optimize inventory, allocate resources effectively, and plan for market demand. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to incorporate complex variables like seasonality, promotions, and external economic factors, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based sales prediction system to analyze historical sales data, derive meaningful insights, and forecast future trends. By leveraging advanced regression models and neural networks, the solution aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of sales predictions, empowering businesses to make data-driven decisions and enhance operational efficiency.

## Objectives
To build a robust machine learning pipeline for sales forecasting.
To implement feature engineering and statistical analysis to improve prediction accuracy.
To compare traditional machine learning models with advanced deep learning approaches.
## Approach
Data loading and preprocessing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and relationships.
Feature engineering to improve model input.
Application of multiple regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and deep learning models like LSTM.
Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best results.
